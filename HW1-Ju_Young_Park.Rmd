========================================================

### 1. Use the GEOmetabd package to f ind all HCV gene expression data using the Illumina platform submitted by an investigator at Yale. This should be done with a single query, showing the title, the GSE accession number, the GPL accession number and the manufacturer and the description of the platform used.

# Connecting to GEOdatabase
```{r eval=FALSE}
library(GEOmetadb)
geo_con <-dbConnect(SQLite(),'GEOmetadb.sqlite')
dbListTables(geo_con)
dbListFields(geo_con,'gse_gpl')
```

# Finding all HCV gene expression data 
```{r eval=FALSE}    
dbGetQuery(geo_con, "SELECT gse.title, gse.gse, gpl.gpl, gpl.manufacturer, gpl.description FROM (gse JOIN gse_gpl ON gse.gse=gse_gpl.gse) j JOIN gpl ON j.gpl=gpl.gpl WHERE gpl.Title LIKE '%Illumina%' AND gse.contact LIKE '%Institute: Yale %'  AND gse.Title LIKE '%HCV%' LIMIT 5;")
```

# Results

### 2. Reproduce your above query using the data.table package. Again, try to use a single line of code. [Hint: You first need to convert all db tables to data.table tables].
 
# Converting all db tables to data.table tables
```{r eval=FALSE}
library(data.table)    
gse.dt <-data.table(dbGetQuery(geo_con,"SELECT * FROM gse"))
gse_gpl.dt <-data.table(dbGetQuery(geo_con,"SELECT * FROM gse_gpl"))
gpl.dt <-data.table(dbGetQuery(geo_con,"SELECT * FROM gpl"))

setkey(gse.dt,gse)
setkey(gse_gpl.dt,gse)
merge1<-merge(gse.dt,gse_gpl.dt)

setkey(merge1,gpl)
setkey(gpl.dt,gpl)
merge2<-merge(merge1,gpl.dt)
```

# Reproducing above(#1) query using the data.table package
```{r eval=FALSE}
merge2[title.x %like% "HCV" & contact.x %like% "Yale"& manufacturer %like% "Illumina",list(gse,gpl,manufacturer,description)]
```
